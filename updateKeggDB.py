"""
Retrieves the taxonomy file and updates organisms that were not present.

Retrieves the taxonomy file listing all organisms and updates the gene ID to
KO mapping files via the KEGG REST API for all organisms specified in the
taxonomy file that were not already present. Modules are also updated.
Files are saved as text files within a subdirectory. Existing files will be
overwritten.

Usage: updateKeggDB.py
